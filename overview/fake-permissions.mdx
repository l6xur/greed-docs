When running the `fakepermissions` command you will be asked to provide a permission, for example: `,fakepermissions @Moderator manage_nicknames`

<Warning>This command only allows the user to bypass permission checks in **greed** they don't actually get the permission, for example: A moderator gets `ban_members` permission through fake permissions, they will only be able to ban users by running `,ban` through **greed** and not any other bot or the Discord client.</Warning>
